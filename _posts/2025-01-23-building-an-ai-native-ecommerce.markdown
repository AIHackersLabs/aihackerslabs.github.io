Welcome to the first post in our new blog series! We’re the `AI Hackers Labs Prototyping Team`, a group of engineers and researchers passionate about harnessing the transformative power of AI. Our mission is to explore the cutting edge of AI, develop innovative prototypes, and share our findings with the community.

Our work is guided by principles of openness and collaboration. This blog serves as a space where we share our technical insights, case studies, best practices, and contributions to the open-source ecosystem. We’re excited to bring you along as we embark on a unique prototyping journey: building an AI Native Ecommerce platform.

## What We Want to Do and Why

We recently launched a merchandise Ecommerce site for AI Hackers (hosted at [AI Hackers Shop][ai-hackers-shop]). While having an online store is exciting, ecommerce isn’t our core business. This prompted a big question: Is it possible to fully automate the management of an ecommerce store?

The idea of reducing or even eliminating manual intervention in areas like catalog management, customer support, and marketing is intriguing. At AI Hackers Labs, we’re diving into this challenge to see what’s possible. Over a series of posts, we’ll share our progress, prototypes, and lessons learned as we test AI-driven automation across key areas of the business. Let's evolve the concept of `AI-native` from buzzword to reality!

## What We Have Set Up

To get started, we’ve established the foundation for our experiments:

- **Shopify Store + Printful**: We’ve integrated a Shopify store with Printful to handle product printing and fulfillment. This setup allows us to focus on prototyping AI solutions without worrying about logistics.

- **Shopify Partner Registration**: We’ve registered as Shopify partners, giving us access to developer tools and resources to build and test custom solutions. This model of collaboration mimics reality,

Bite by bite. We believe in taking things one step at a time. Here’s our roadmap for the journey:

### Things We Are Tackling

We’ll be fast prototyping solutions to address critical areas of ecommerce, including:

- **Catalog Management**: Automating tasks like product descriptions, categorization, and pricing adjustments.

- **Customer Support**: Exploring AI chatbots and virtual assistants to provide seamless customer experiences.

- **Personal Shopping Assistance**: Developing recommendation systems that mimic a personal shopping assistant.

- **Marketing Campaigns Management**: Using AI to audit, create, schedule, and optimize ad campaigns for maximum impact.

And this is just the beginning. As we progress, we expect to uncover even more opportunities for automation.

### How We Defined Our Roadmap

To define our approach, we’ve leveraged Experimentor, a structured discovery process that helps identify pain points and prioritize solutions. By breaking down the ecommerce ecosystem into manageable components, we’ve created a clear, step-by-step plan for testing and implementing AI prototypes.

## What’s Next

In our next post, we’ll dive deeper into the first area of focus: catalog management. We’ll share the tools, techniques, and initial results from our experiments. Stay tuned as we take the first bite out of the elephant and set the stage for a fully automated AI Native Ecommerce platform.

Follow our journey and share your thoughts with us. Let’s explore the future of ecommerce together!
